# Overview

Fanify introduces a new game plan for sports prediction markets — where collective fan sentiment becomes alpha and directly shapes the odds. Built on a fully decentralized stack, the protocol transforms passive supporters into on-chain market makers, enabling real-time, dynamic odds through a trustless and transparent system.

But we don’t stop at odds.

Fanify amplifies community engagement by enabling staking mechanisms inspired by DeFi-native liquidity pools. Fans can stake their support via seasonal yield farming campaigns, earning rewards while backing their teams — not just with emotion, but with capital.

This is Web3 meets the stadium. Permissionless. Composable. Fan-powered.
